Testing Keylogger.exe

1. Open Command Prompt to check Startup folder is empty. Paste the follwing line:
	cd C:\Users\IEUser\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

2. Now run the desktop programm (Keylogger.exe). This is a daemon Keylogger so you'll not going to see any change.

3. Type up to 500 characters. 

4. Once the number of characters is 500 a check the mailbox to see the log.txt content. We are sending this logs (different each other) to teamcyber5412@gamil.com, with password new_password100 every 500 characters introduced.

5. Before shutting down the VM, check that the executable is now on:
	cd C:\Users\IEUser\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

6. If the computer is restarted the Keylogger.exe should be able to execute normally. But it seems there's a bug here we were not able to fix.  (There's no persistence at the moment)
